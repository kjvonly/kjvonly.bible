# Overview

This page will discuss how panes are displayed on the screen visually. Then a high level discussion about the code that makes this happen.

## Visually
If you can understand the concept of a `Pane` the layout will make sense.The image below is showing a single `Pane` named `a`.

![single pane](/img/mental-models/overview/01_image.png)



The below image is displaying 2 `Panes` split vertically. This was accomplished by instructing the `PaneService` to split `Pane a` vertically.  

![two panes split vertically](/img/mental-models/overview/02_image.png)

The below image is displaying 3. Now we split `Pane b` horizontally to get `Pane b` and `Pane c`. Again we instructed the `PaneService` to split `Pane b`

![3 panes split vertically first, then the b pane split horizontally](/img/mental-models/overview/03_image.png)


Lastly, the below image is displaying 4 `Pane`'s. We split `Pane a` horizontally to get `Pane a` and `Pane d`. Again we instructed the `PaneService` to split `Pane a`

## Pane Data Structure

The data structure used is the conventional `Tree`/`Node`


!!! note
    Pane data structure is different than the Pane component.


```Typescript
/* pane.model.ts */
export interface Pane {
    id: string | any;
    left: Pane | any;
    right: Pane | any;
    split: string | any;
    buffer: any;
}
```

There are two types `Pane`s. A branch `Pane` and leaf `Pane`. 

## A Simple Example

```typescript
let root = {
            split: 'v',
            left: {
                id: 'a',
                buffer: {},
            },
            right: {
                id: 'b',
                buffer: {},
            }
        }
```

### Branch Pane
A branch `Pane` only contains a `left` and `right` pane and a `split`.

In the example above, the left and right `Pane`s are `a` and `b` with a vertical split (`v` is vertical).


### Leaf Pane
A leaf `Pane` contains an `id` and a `buffer`.

In the example above the left `Pane` is `a` and the right `Pane` is b.

!!! note
    A buffer a data structure holds the information about what `Module` to display in the `Pane` i.e. Chapter, Search, Modules etc... 

## DOM rendering

How do we render the panes in the DOM and what considerations needed to be considered? 

### Grid Template Area

checkout the MDN docs for ðŸ‘‰ [grid-template-area docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas). The grid-template-areas CSS property specifies named grid areas, establishing the cells in the grid and assigning them names.

### `grid-template-area` examples
```css
example1 {
    grid-template-areas: 
                "a a a"
                "b c c"
                "b c c";
}

example2 {
    grid-template-areas: 
                "b b a"
                "b b c"
                "b b c";
}
```

What we do to render the `Pane`s in the proper position is recursively render a `grid-template-area` similar to the above example from the `Pane` tree/node data structure discussed in the section above. The constraint placed on rendering the `grid-template-area` is the ratio of each area must be respected.

!!! important
    The algorithm used to render the `grid-template-area` is in the `dynamicGrid.service.ts` file. It's a recursive algorithm that starts at left leaf node and joins the left and right leafs at the branch node all the way up the tree respecting the area ratios.

### A Visual Example 

A single `Pane` `grid-template-area` would look like this.ðŸ‘‡

```css
example {
    grid-template-areas:
    			"a";
}
```


```typescript
let root = {
    id: 'a',
    buffer: {},
}

```


Splitting `Pane` `a` vertically  `grid-template-area` would look like this.ðŸ‘‡


```css
example {
    grid-template-areas:
    			"a b";
}
```

```typescript
let root = {
            split: 'v',
            left: {
                id: 'a',
                buffer: {},
            },
            right: {
                id: 'b',
                buffer: {},
            }
        }
```



Splitting `Pane` `b` horizontally  `grid-template-area` would look like this.ðŸ‘‡

!!! note
    See how `Pane` `a`s area spans row 0 and row 1. This keeps the ratio of panes correct. The height of `a` is twice the size of `b` or `c`.

```css
example {
    grid-template-areas:
    			"a b"
                "a c"
}
```

```typescript
let root = {
            split: 'v',
            left: {
                id: 'a',
                buffer: {},
            },
            right: {
                split: 'h',
                left: {
                    id: 'b',
                    buffer: {},
                }
                right: {
                    id: 'c',
                    buffer: {},
                }
                
            }
        }
```



Splitting `Pane` `a` horizontally  `grid-template-area` would look like this.ðŸ‘‡

!!! note
    See how `Pane` `a`s area reduces after adding `Pane` `d`

```css
example {
    grid-template-areas:
    			"a b"
                "d c"
}
```

```typescript
let root = {
            split: 'v',
            left: {
                split: 'h'
                left: {
                    id: 'a',
                    buffer: {},
                },
                right: {
                    id: 'd',
                    buffer: {}
                }
            },
            right: {
                split: 'h',
                left: {
                    id: 'b',
                    buffer: {},
                }
                right: {
                    id: 'c',
                    buffer: {},
                }
            }
        }
```
### HTML for grid-template-area

The html for `grid-template-areas` will look similar to this.

```html

<div class="grid">
  <div style="grid-area: a;">a</div>
  <div style="grid-area: b;">b</div>
  <div style="grid-area: c;">d</div>
  <div style="grid-area: d;">d</div>
</div>
```

```css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
    			"a b"
                "d c"
}
```

#### Dynamically

Dynamically we track the pane ids in a `string[]` and render the pane to the `DOM` this way. ðŸ‘‡

```svelte
{#each panes as paneId}
            <div style="grid-area: {paneId};">
            <PaneContainer {paneId}></PaneContainer>
        </div>
{/each}
```

!!! danger
    This is great but there is a constraint we must adhere to about rerendering panes in the DOM that do not need to be rerendered. For example if we delete `Pane` `b` then `Pane` `c` should fill the area of `b`. If the `panes` array changes,  `Pane` `b` is deleted in this example, then `Pane` `d` is now in index 2 of the array then `Pane` `d` will be rerendered causing issues. Notably, if `Pane` `d` was displaying a bible chapter and the user had scrolled to the middle of the chapter, rerendering `Pane` `d` would then have the scroll set to 0 resulting in the first verse being displayed instead of the middle of the chapter.

##### Prevent DOM From Rerendering Panes

To remedy the issue of rerendering the `Pane`s that should not be rerendered we never remove a `Pand` id from the `panes` array. Instead we track the deleted panes and conditionally choose not to display them. See below ðŸ‘‡

```svelte
{#each panes as paneId}
    {#if !deletedPanes[paneId]}
        <div style="grid-area: {paneId};">
            <PaneContainer {paneId}></PaneContainer>
        </div>
    {/if}
{/each}
```
